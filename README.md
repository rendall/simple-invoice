## Roadmap

Nothing more planned, but please make suggestions if you would find this useful

Possibilities, if there is demand:

- Choose localization (e.g. "US", "FI", etc.) for currency and date formats

## Development

The `script.ts` file compiles into `script.js`, which is loaded by `index.html` when displayed by a web server

 - `npm install`
 - `npm run build`
